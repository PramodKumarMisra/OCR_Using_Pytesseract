# OCR_Using_Pytesseract
Welcome to Optical Character Recognition  Engine Using Pytesseract(OCR-tesseract),OpenCV &amp; Python

What is OCR-tesseract??
    OCR stand for Optical character recognition.
Tesseract is a open source neural network model developed by Google.
Using this model we are convert image text into text file from scan PDF, Images.




Why i used Tesseract for text Recognition?
     Because it is very good accauracy as compaired to other NLP Model.
     Its freeware and open source.
     easily intrgated with python 
     Its is also easily intregated with OpenCV as well.
     
     
 Steps Involved to using tessract:-
     .Import pytesseract (For installation see wiki documentaion link)
     .Import CV2 
     .Import PDF2image 
    and intall poppler for windows and set path  (see wiki page )
    
    
What problems faced during executing this project??
    Its very important that when i execute this model we have faced lots of technical issues that i had been solved by stackoverflow and searching exactly error on google.
    1.Poppler installation problem 
    2. tesseract path setup in /:C drive
