***Welcome to Optical Character Recognition  Engine Using Pytesseract(OCR-tesseract),OpenCV &Python***

**What is OCR-tesseract??**

  OCR stand for Optical character recognition.
Tesseract is a open source neural network model developed by Google.
Using this model we are convert image text into text file from scan PDF, Images.




**Why i used Tesseract for text Recognition?**
     Because it is very good accauracy as compared to other NLP Model.
     Its freeware and open source.
     easily intrgated with python 
     Its is also easily intregated with OpenCV as well.
     
     
 **Steps Involved to using tessract:-**
     .Import pytesseract (For installation see wiki documentaion link)
     .Import CV2 
     .Import PDF2image 
    and intall poppler for windows and set path  (see wiki page )
    
    
**What problems faced during executing this project??**

   Its very important that when i execute this model we have faced lots of technical issues that i had been solved by ***stackoverflow*** and searching exactly error on google.
   
   ***Poppler installation problem ***
   
   ***Tesseract path setup in /:C drive***
